	 * enabled check is only of interest when getting a property description
	 * {@link #getDescription(int, int, int)}.
	 *
	 * @param localEP the local endpoint of the connection, supply the wildcard address to use a
	 *        local IP on the same subnet as <code>serverCtrlEP</code> and an unused (ephemeral) port
	 * @param serverCtrlEP the remote server control endpoint used for connect request
	 * @param useNat <code>true</code> to use a network address translation aware communication
	 *        mechanism, <code>false</code> to use the default way
	 * @param adapterClosed receives notification about adapter close event
	 * @param queryWriteEnable <code>true</code> to check whether a property is write enabled or
	 *        read only, <code>false</code> to skip the check
	 * @throws KNXException on failure establishing local device management connection or failure
	 *         while initializing the property adapter
